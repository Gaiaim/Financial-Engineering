# Final Project 9A – Financial Engineering - Gaia Imperatore and Federico Crivellaro

## Structured Credit: Tranche Pricing and Correlation Modeling

This repository contains the full implementation and documentation of the final project for the Financial Engineering course held by professor Roberto Baviera at Politecnico di Milano. The project focuses on pricing Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) tranches on a large homogeneous portfolio of mortgages, using various credit risk models and correlation structures.

The objective is to calibrate, analyze, and compare the following models:
- Double t-Student copula with real-valued degrees of freedom
- Vasicek (Gaussian one-factor) copula
- Li's Gaussian copula model with constant intensity (optional)

Model calibration is based on market-implied correlations provided via tranche quotes, and pricing accuracy is evaluated under the Large Homogeneous Portfolio (LHP) approximation. The project also includes an analysis of pricing sensitivity with respect to portfolio size and tranche bounds.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Open `runProject.m` in MATLAB.
2. Ensure that `TrancheCorrelations.xlsx` is located in the `data/` folder.
3. Execute the script to:
   - Calibrate the double t-Student model to market tranche data.
   - Plot and compare pricing results under different approximations (Exact, KL, LHP).
   - Evaluate the effect of portfolio size on tranche pricing (log-scale analysis).

Optional Python implementations may be included for extended analysis and validation.
